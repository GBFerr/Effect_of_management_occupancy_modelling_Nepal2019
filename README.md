Code used in the paper assessing the effect of different management regimes on wildlife in and around Bardiya National Park

1) extract % land cover from raster file to be used as covariate in the analysis - other variable were obtained from field forms and QGIS; also exploring some covariates
2) generate site by date matrices of species occurrence - this is the detection/non-detection data used in the multi-species occupancy models
